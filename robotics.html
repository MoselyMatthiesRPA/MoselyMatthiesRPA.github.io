    The First Tech Challenge, or FTC for short, is a robotics competition for highschool students. <br> This year, the challenge is called centerstage, and the main objective is to get hexagonal tiles called pixels onto the back board,<br> and you can get extra points by hanging off the trusses in the center of the arena or by shooting a paper airplane to a specified area.
